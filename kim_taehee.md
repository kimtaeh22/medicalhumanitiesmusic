# 말아톤(film maraton)

“Run, Cho-won” is featured in the film’s final marathon sequence, portraying a powerful moment in which the protagonist, who has autism spectrum disorder, overcomes his limitations and connects with the world. Composer Kim Joon-sung uses a delicate interplay of piano and strings to express Cho-won’s inner tension, deep concentration, and eventual sense of freedom. Beyond mere storytelling, the music conveys the complexity of Cho-won’s emotions, offering a non-stereotypical perspective on disability. Rather than marking him as "special" or "different," the music respectfully reveals his unique emotional world and subtly reminds us that his feelings and experiences are not unlike those of anyone else. It transforms the perception of disability into a different but equally valid way of experiencing life.
